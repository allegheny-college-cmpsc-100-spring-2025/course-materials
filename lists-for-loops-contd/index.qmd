# While-loops and For Loops

In computer programming, the same problem often has many solutions. 

These two blocks of code are effectively the same:

``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
<br/>
``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"}
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

# Lists in VPython

You can use lists in VPython to store a group of shapes. 

``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"}
# creates a list of three shapes
shapes = [sphere(), box(), pyramid()] 
shapes[0].pos.x = -3 # moves first shape in list to left
shapes[2].pos.x = 3 # moves last shape in list to right
```

# For Loops in VPython

When elements are stored in a list, you can perform the same operation easily on each of them with a for loop. 

``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"}
# ... CONTINUES CODE FROM PREVIOUS SLIDE
for shp in shapes:
    shp.color = vector(1, 0, 0)
```

# `append()` Function

The `append()` function in Python adds an item to the end of a list. 

``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"} 
nums = [] # creates an empty list and stores it in variable nums
nums.append(5) # appends 5 to list
nums.append(3) # appends 3 to list
print(nums) # outputs [5, 3]
```

# Using `append()` in VPython

![](image-1.png)

You can use the `append()` function to add shapes to a list that you can later iterate through with a for-loop. 

[See example on Trinket.](https://trinket.io/glowscript/6fd60699df)

# `len()` Function

The `len()` function returns the number of items in a list when the argument is a list datatype. It returns the number of characters in a string if the argument is a string datatype. 

<br>

``` {.python code-line-numbers="false"} 
len("cat") # returns 3
len([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) # returns 5

```

# Using the len() function to get list position

![](image-2.png)

If you want to iterate through a list AND use the current position of the list, the `len()` function can help you do it. 

[This example](https://trinket.io/glowscript/45b1bfbf80) modifies an earlier, getting the index of the current earth  to determine the angle of rotation. This means each earth rotates at a different speed.

Remember you can make a remix of any Trinket demo I post and change the code to see what happens! Trything things out is a low-risk way to learn.
