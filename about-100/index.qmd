# Course Expectations

- Get excited that it's hard! More effort = more reward
- (Expect and embrace frustration)
- Standard college course expectation: 5-10 hours of work outside class time
- If something doesn't come together in lecture, use resources provided in syllabus to help you understand. Take the time to figure out how you learn best. 
- Read each word of written instructions

# Where to Find Content

You can find all the GitHub and Discord links you need on the Canvas homepage, but you'll turn in assignments on GitHub, not Canvas. 

![Alt text](image-7.png)

This course uses GitHub Classroom instead of Canvas for assignment submission. This is because GitHub classroom is specialized for coding instruction, and Canvas is not.

Course updates will be posted in Discord.

# Discord

<img src = "image-1.png" width = "400px" />

Discord is a messaging and sharing platform that allows people to exchange all kinds of media in a variety of formats. It will be the primary source of communication for this class, so you'll be expected to have an account and stay active.

# GitHub

<img src = "image-2.png" width = "300px" />

GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting code.  It is an industry standard tool and knowing it unlocks countless doors. 

A Git repository (or repo) is essentially a folder for code, where you can collaborate manage version history. It will often also include instructions.  

Each assignment in this class links to a different GitHub repo.

# Python

<img src = "image-6.png" width = "300px" />

Python is the programming language we will use in this class. It is known for being readable and versatile: there are many free open-source libraries you can use to extend Python's capabilities.

# VPython

<img src = "image-4.png" width = "400px" />
VPython is a Python library that allows you to render 3D graphics in Python language. Python libaries (sometimes called modules) need to be imported so we can access their capabilities.

# Trinket

<img src = "image-5.png" width = "500px" />

Trinket is a browser-based coding platform that we will use in the first half of the semester so that we can code right away without having to install anything.

We will be using two kinds of Trinket in this class: Python and VPython. VPython trinkets have the VPython module already imported. Python trinkets only include the base Python language.

# Markdown
## another header
### a smaller header
 
Documents that end with `.md` (like this one!) will render as **markdown**. It is a lightweight markup system that allows you to format text professionally.

In this class, you'll be expected to edit markdown files. Instructions will also be provided in this format.

# Laptops

This course requires a laptop with the specifications linked in the syllabus. 

If your laptop isn't ideal for coding, you can request a loaner laptop using the form linked in the syllabus. Sometimes it's a good idea to borrow a department laptop so your code isn't competing for RAM with your games etc. :::

# Attendance Today

## When I call you, tell us...

1. Whatever name you prefer to be called
2. Your pronouns, if you want to
3. Description of a time a computer or piece of software has messed up or failed you! OR a time when software has helped you a lot. 
4. Your preferred name again.

## Request!

Please sit in the same spot for the first couple weeks of class while I am learning everyone's name. (It will take me a little time.)
