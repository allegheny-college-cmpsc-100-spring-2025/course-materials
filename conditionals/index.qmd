## Introduction to If Statements in Python

In Python, `if` statements are used for conditional execution. They allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

<br>

```python
# Example of an if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

<br>

This example will print "x is greater than 5" because the condition `x > 5` evaluates to `True`.

## If-Else Statements in Python

In Python, `if-else` statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

<br>

```python
# Example of an if-else statement
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

<br>

In this example, since `x` is not greater than 5, the code block under the `else` statement will be executed, printing "x is not greater than 5".

# If Statement in VPython

<img src = "image.png" width = "450px" />

```python
# i is equal to 0 then 1 then 2.... then 8
for i in range(9):
  x = i * 2 - 8 # x pos var as function of i
  # draw ring and position with x
  r = ring(pos = vector(x, 0, 0)) 
  if i > 5: # if i > 5, color ring yellow
    r.color = vector(1, 1, 0)
```

# If-else in VPython

<img src = "image-1.png" width = "450px" />

This example adds an else statement to the last one.
